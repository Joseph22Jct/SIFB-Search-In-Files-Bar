<p>
This Godot plugin was created because I do not like the built-in Godot's "search in files" solution.
The plugin aims to quickly and comfortable browse to files much easier, <b>Including built-in scripts</b>
</p>

<h2>Installation: </h2>
<p>Simply download the addon folder, and place it on the root of your godot project, after that,
go to the Project Tab > Project Settings... > Plugins tab > Enable Search In Files Bar.</p>

<h2>How to Use: </h2>
<p>
  Open the Dock by either clicking on "Search in Files" tab at the bottom dock, or press <b>"Shift+Ctrl+G"</b>
  To quickly search something, once you have the tab open, simply press <b>"Shift+G"</b> to focus on the search bar.
  You can of course select different options within your search, once you press enter from the input field, or press the Search button,
  Results will show up on the bottom dock. Pressing these will lead you to the file and line of code in question :)
</p>

<h1>Enjoy!</h1>
