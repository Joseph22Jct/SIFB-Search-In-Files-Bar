![showcase](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f31580df-ac71-457a-9b94-e557b784d17f)

<p>
This Godot plugin was created because I wanted a more robust search solution for finding code in files. <br/>
The plugin aims to quickly and comfortable browse to files much easier, <b>Including built-in scripts</b>
</p>

<h2>Installation: </h2>
<p>Simply download the addon folder, and place it on the root of your godot project, after that,<br/>
go to the Project Tab > Project Settings... > Plugins tab > Enable Search In Files Bar.</p>

<h2>How to Use: </h2>
<p>
  Open the Dock by either clicking on "Search in Files" tab at the bottom dock, or press <b>"Shift+Ctrl+G"</b> <br/>
  To quickly search something, once you have the tab open, simply press <b>"Shift+G"</b> to focus on the search bar. <br/>
  You can of course select different options within your search, once you press enter from the input field, or press the Search button, <br/>
  Results will show up on the bottom dock. Pressing these will show you to the file and line of code in question in your editor of choice :)
